Solar power is the future of renewable power generation. The problem with solar panels is that they use up a lot of space on rooftops or open areas and are difficult to mount, maintain and clean regularly. Additionally the solar panels is moved as per sun position can generate upto 40% more solar power.
We here by propose a new kind of solar panels that can be mounted on water bodies like lake pools so that they donâ€™t occupy any land space. Additionally we introduce an innovative sun tracker and panel movement system using hydraulic mechanism to move the solar panels as per sun position and generate more power.

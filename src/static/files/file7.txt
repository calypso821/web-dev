In this data mining project, a housing dataset is used which includes all the prices of the different houses. In this project, the dataset for prediction of price is added along with location, size of the house, and additional information required for it. Depending on the level of sophistication, you can follow a predictive model with simple techniques such as regressions or machine learning libraries. The application of this project is in the real estate companies. This project utilizes algorithms and techniques for price predictions of the houses based on different housing datasets. Either you can carry out linear regression with a data analytics tool such as Tableau or Excel, or you can choose a machine learning library along with programming language “R” or Python.

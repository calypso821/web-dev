Step aboard one of the most detailed Starships ever made in this genre-defining space simulation. Serve as part of the crew on mankinds first-ever deep space exploration vessel, where billions of distant uncharted worlds are waiting to inspire, awe, and challenge you. Do you have what it takes? Starship Simulator is a true work of passion, born of many a childhood dream to experience what it would truly be like to live and work on a massive deep space exploration vessel, just like the ones you see depicted in classic science fiction. A dream of walking among the stars, exploring distant worlds, and answering one of mankinds oldest questions... what awaits us in the great unknown?
